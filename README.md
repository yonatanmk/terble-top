# Terble-Top

A small web app for helping you determine what boardgame to play in your group. After logging in with Google OAuth you will be prompted to provide your boardgamegeek username. The app will then fetch all of your boardgames from your BBG profile. You can then enter the size of your group and the site will list all of the boardgames in your possession that can be played with that number of players.
